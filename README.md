## Introduction
With this project we want to study the phenomenon of the police brutality in the U.S. and in particular if there is a racial bias in the actions of the police. 
In particular we have focused our work on the study of the risks associated with being an Afro-American people or an Hispanic one distinguish also the case of an armed people and an unarmed one.

## Results
We can say that is actually present a racial bias against the Afro-Americans people in all the U.S. while for the Hispanic ones is not a so widespread phenomenon, but it is more restricted to some specific states. 

For a more thoroughly discussion, more plots and all the references, please refer to the project report.
